Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

The dataset includes 8177 images.
Different-type-of-answers are annotated in YOLOv12 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 54x54 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -12 and +12 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -13째 to +13째 vertically
